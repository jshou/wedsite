          <h3 class="title">The Story</h3>
          <p>Josh and Rosanna were brought together under absurd and peculiar circumstances. Having both agreed to help a mutual friend with a film class assignment, they met for the first time one rainy November night and sat quietly together to watch Pan’s Labyrinth while their film studies friend sat adjacently to examine and record their reactions to the movie. As the evening progressed, the rigidly formed pair delved further into their minimally interactive exchange, forming quiet observations that piqued their curiosity ever so subtly. It was clear upon second and third encounters that the two had a natural affinity, evident from their shared appreciation of campy martial arts films and bonding over sorta being third culture kids.</p>

          <p>What was to follow was a propulsion into a flurry of adventure and excitement fueled by growing infatuation and a rapport firmly grounded in a mutually unabashed love of puns. They proved their loyalty and commitment through their steadfast stance in the face of calamities, not excluding arson-induced car explosions at Josh’s crappy university apartment and stress-inducing Starcraft battles. Five years and innumerable sunrise diner dates and late night Jazz Alley shows later, Josh and Rosanna shared a moment of telepathic revelation that they could no longer resist or deny the meant-to-be-ness of marriage in their partnership. They are contagiously giddy to at last upgrade their relationship to Mr. and Mrs. and boldly go… where they have never gone before.</p>
